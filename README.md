# VQVAE-Toy-Implementation
A stolen implementation of VQVAE for study.

Implementation from [here](https://github.com/bshall/VectorQuantizedVAE)

## Results
Trained for 4000 training steps with batch size of 32. I've used the FFHQ dataset. Default parameters. Image size (128, 128, 3). The reconstrucion results from the test set are pretty cool:

## Why?
I need to understand VQVAEs for a personal project and I've found a cool implementation. Now I've understood VQVAEs and I'm a happier person overall.
